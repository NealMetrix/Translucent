# Translucent

This is about trying to test how the gl blending functions with OpenGL. Although this seems to be almost a lesson on how to structure your code and almost a lesson on what
happens if you don't plan ahead for your coding projects. I am still in the set up stages and haven't even written my own shaders yet and have still been working with the default shaders OpenGL sometimes generates depending on your GPU drivers. My GPU drivers do have a default shader on it so I don't even need to have a shader written to start drawing verticies.
