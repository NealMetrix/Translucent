# Translucent

I finished everything needed to draw rectangles to squares. I also added some overdue user functionality such as...
- A bind function so the user can bind what function they are working on(Was in my previous pushed branch but was very broken)
- A delete function to delete specific rectangles/quadralaterals that the user specifies
- A way to display the list of rectangle names the user has generated so far
- Added a command for the user to use to clear the screen(I hope to be using this a lot more now that I know about it)

# Next Steps
Now I can start using this to test what I wanted to test it for and use it to test how to change how the alpha value works in OpenGL. I want to learn how to change things such as opacity or transparency. So I will be first trying to figure out the best place on where to put the blending functions to get my OpenGL functions to work properly. They probably will end up going in the shader object but maybe not... You never know what will happen when your program throws you a curve ball to debug.
