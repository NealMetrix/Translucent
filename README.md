# Translucent
Okay no joke that was WAY easier than I thought it would be. I thought that I would have to spend hours trying to figure out how the programs work but it wans't hard it was litterally just 3 lines of code that I added and then it worked. I did make sure I knew why the math that I inserted for the glBlendFunc and the glBlendEquation were really good representations for how to do opacity. But I didn't think that litterally that's all there was to it. Maybe textures will end up being the thing that give me the most trouble as it looks like there's a lot more to understand about setting up textures and all the parameters that go with them that you could potentially misunderstand or mess up. But I am sure I am up to the challenge.
