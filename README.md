# Translucent

This is an attempt at trying to do translucency with OpenGL. This is actually a branch that I didn't complete because I felt
it was a good example of how to not structure your code because I put myself in the situation where I had to completely
restructure 1 or both of my classes. To find out more details look at the code itself. I wrote comments that mapped out
my thought process. I will put the correct code in a different branch.
